## 🔬 Technical Approach

### Compression Pipeline

```
Input: FP16/FP32 weights
    ↓
1. Quantize to INT8 (2x compression)
    ↓
2. Predictive Coding (PLANAR mode)
   - Predict each value from neighbors
   - Store residuals (differences)
    ↓  
3. Differential Encoding
   - Convert to uint8 with offset
    ↓
4. rANS Entropy Coding
   - Compress based on frequency distribution
   - Global frequency table for efficiency
    ↓
Output: Compressed bytes (1.54x additional compression)
```

### Decompression Pipeline (GPU-Accelerated)

```
Input: Compressed bytes
    ↓
1. rANS Decode (GPU kernel)
   - Decode compressed stream to differentials
    ↓
2. Differential Decode (GPU kernel)
   - Reconstruct int8 residuals
    ↓
3. Inverse Prediction (GPU kernel)
   - Reconstruct original values from residuals
    ↓
4. Dequantize (if needed)
   - Scale back to FP16/FP32
    ↓
Output: Bit-exact reconstruction
```
