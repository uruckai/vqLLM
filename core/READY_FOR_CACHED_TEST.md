# Ready for Per-Forward-Pass Caching Test

## What Changed

Implemented **per-forward-pass caching** in `test_zstd_inference.py`:

✅ **Global forward pass counter** tracks which token generation step we're on  
✅ **Layer-level caching** decompresses each layer once per forward pass  
✅ **Cache invalidation** at start of next forward pass frees old weights  
✅ **Decompression tracking** reports total decompressions and forward passes  

## Expected Benefits

### VRAM Usage
- **Before**: 3.86 GB (caching all layers) or 2.08 GB (no cache, super slow)
- **After**: 2.5-3 GB (active layers only, reasonable speed)
- **Goal**: ✓ Achieve VRAM savings while maintaining usability

### Speed
- **Before**: 478x slower (decompressing 2000 times for 10 tokens)
- **After**: 20-50x slower (decompressing 220 times for 10 tokens)
- **Improvement**: 10-24x faster than no-cache version

### Decompressions
- **Before**: ~2000 (decompress on every layer use)
- **After**: ~220 (decompress once per layer per token)
- **Reduction**: 10x fewer decompressions

## How It Works

```
Token 1 generation (forward pass 1):
  - Layer 1: decompress → cache → use 10x → keep cached
  - Layer 2: decompress → cache → use 10x → keep cached
  - ...
  - Layer 20: decompress → cache → use 10x → keep cached

Token 2 generation (forward pass 2):
  - Layer 1: invalidate cache → decompress fresh → cache → use 10x
  - Layer 2: invalidate cache → decompress fresh → cache → use 10x
  - ...
```

**Key insight**: Within a forward pass, each layer is used ~10 times (in different attention heads, MLP sublayers, etc.). We decompress once and reuse, then free for the next pass.

## Test Instructions (RunPod)

```bash
cd /workspace/CodecLLM
git pull
cd core
bash RUN_CACHED_TEST.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
cd /workspace/CodecLLM/core
python test_zstd_inference.py
```

## What to Look For

### Success Indicators
✅ Forward passes: ~11 (prompt + 10 tokens)  
✅ Decompressions: ~220 (20 layers × 11 passes)  
✅ Peak VRAM: 2.5-3 GB (close to baseline 2.06 GB)  
✅ Speed: 20-50x slower (much better than 478x)  

### Failure Indicators
❌ Decompressions >> 220 (cache not working)  
❌ Peak VRAM > 4 GB (not freeing memory)  
❌ Speed still 400x+ slower (no improvement)  

## Example Expected Output

```
[6/6] Running compressed inference...
  Generating tokens...
  Memory before generation: 2.08 GB
  Memory after generation: 2.52 GB
  Memory peak: 2.76 GB
  Memory delta: +0.44 GB
  Output: 'The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is'
  Time: 12.50s
  Forward passes: 11
  Decompressions: 220

================================================================================
RESULTS SUMMARY
================================================================================

Baseline:
  Time: 0.57s
  VRAM: 2.06 GB
  Output: 'The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is'

Compressed (Zstd):
  Time: 12.50s (22x slower)
  VRAM: 2.76 GB (0.75x reduction)
  Compression: 3.50x
  Compressed layers: 20/155
  Forward passes: 11
  Decompressions: 220 (20.0 per forward pass)
  Output: 'The capital of France is Paris. The capital of France is'

✓ Output matches baseline (perfect reconstruction)
```

## Why This Achieves VRAM Savings

**The key difference from baseline:**

1. **Baseline**: All 20 layers always in VRAM
2. **Compressed**: 20 layers compressed in RAM (3.5x smaller), decompressed on demand

**At peak VRAM:**
- Base model: 2.0 GB (uncompressed layers)
- Active decompressed: ~0.5 GB (20 layers being used)
- Activations: ~0.2 GB (forward pass intermediates)
- **Total**: 2.7 GB

**But we freed 20 layers from VRAM** (moved to compressed RAM), giving us headroom to:
- Compress more layers (40, 60, 80...)
- Use larger batch sizes
- Load multiple models

**Example with 60 compressed layers:**
- Baseline: 3.5 GB (all in VRAM)
- Compressed: 2.7 GB peak (most in RAM, active in VRAM)
- **Savings**: 0.8 GB = 23% reduction

## Next Steps

1. **Run test**: Verify per-forward-pass caching works
2. **Increase compression**: Try 40, 60, 80 layers
3. **Measure scaling**: Plot VRAM vs. # compressed layers
4. **Optimize speed**: Async decompression, batched decode
