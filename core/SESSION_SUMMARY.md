# Session Summary - Quantization Debugging Setup

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: Ready for RunPod testing  
**Goal**: Diagnose and fix quantization artifacts from playbook

---

## üìã What I Did

### 1. Created Progressive Test Suite
- **`test_progressive_compression.py`**: Tests 1, 5, 10, and 20 compressed layers
  - Automatically reloads model between tests to avoid state issues
  - Compares output quality vs baseline
  - Tracks time, VRAM, compression ratio
  - Clear quality indicators (‚úì PERFECT, ‚ö† MINOR DIFF, ‚úó MAJOR DIFF)

### 2. Created Diagnostic Script
- **`check_runpod_status.py`**: Verifies RunPod environment before testing
  - Checks CUDA availability
  - Verifies codec library built
  - Tests GPU decoder
  - Validates compression round-trip
  - Tests GPU decode to device pointer

### 3. Created Runner Script
- **`RUN_PROGRESSIVE_TEST.sh`**: One-command test execution
  - Pulls latest code
  - Builds if needed
  - Runs progressive test

### 4. Created Comprehensive Instructions
- **`RUNPOD_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**: Complete testing guide
  - Step-by-step commands
  - Expected outputs
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Decision tree for interpreting results

## üöÄ What You Should Do Next

### On Your RunPod:

```bash
# Step 1: Pull the code (just pushed)
cd /workspace/CodecLLM
git pull

# Step 2: Check environment is ready
cd core
python3 check_runpod_status.py

# Step 3: Run progressive test
python3 test_progressive_compression.py
```

**Time required**: ~10 minutes total

## üîç What We're Looking For

### The Key Question:
**Does the output show ‚úì PERFECT or ‚ö† MINOR DIFF?**

- **YES** ‚Üí Quantization is working! Scale to more layers
- **NO (‚úó MAJOR DIFF)** ‚Üí Quantization broke again, need to debug

### Example Good Output:
```
Layers   Time        VRAM       Ratio   Quality         Output
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1        2.5s        2.08 GB    1.35x   ‚úì PERFECT       'The capital of France is Paris...'
5        8.2s        2.10 GB    1.33x   ‚úì PERFECT       'The capital of France is Paris...'
10       15.1s       2.12 GB    1.34x   ‚ö† MINOR DIFF    'The capital of France is Paris...'
20       28.4s       2.15 GB    1.35x   ‚ö† MINOR DIFF    'The capital of France is Paris...'
```

### Example Bad Output (Quantization Broken):
```
Layers   Time        VRAM       Ratio   Quality         Output
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1        2.5s        2.08 GB    1.35x   ‚úó MAJOR DIFF    'The capital of France is, 1...'
5        8.2s        2.10 GB    1.33x   ‚úó MAJOR DIFF    'The capital of France—É—Å—åÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ...'
```

## üéØ Analysis Plan

### Scenario A: Tests Pass (Good Quality)
**Next steps:**
1. Scale to more layers: Edit line 283 in test_progressive_compression.py
   ```python
   for n in [20, 50, 100, 155]:  # Test larger counts
   ```
2. Focus on performance optimization
3. Update playbook with success story

### Scenario B: Tests Fail (Poor Quality)
**Debug steps:**
1. Run `python3 test_quantization_debug.py` to see per-channel vs per-tensor comparison
2. Check specific issues:
   - **Scales are zeros**: NumPy aliasing bug returned
   - **INT8 wrong**: Compression/decompression issue  
   - **Broadcast wrong**: PyTorch dequantization issue
3. Add more debug prints to test_progressive_compression.py

### Scenario C: Environment Check Fails
**Fix steps:**
1. **Library missing**: `bash build.sh`
2. **GPU decoder unavailable**: `bash INSTALL_NVCOMP3.sh`
3. **Round-trip fails**: Check CUDA with `nvidia-smi`

---

## üìä Context from Playbook

### Last Known State:
- **Test**: 1 layer compressed
- **Output**: "The capital of France is, 1..." (artifacts)
- **Time**: 6.46s (11.5x slower)
- **VRAM**: 2.08 GB (stable)

### What Changed Since:
- Per-channel quantization was implemented
- Scale copying fixed (`.squeeze().copy()`)
- GPU decode working perfectly
- But no recent test to confirm quality

### Why Progressive Test?
The playbook says to "scale layer count to 5-20 layers" as the next immediate step. That's exactly what this test does, automatically!

## üìÅ Files Changed

### New Files (created):
- `test_progressive_compression.py` - Main test script
- `check_runpod_status.py` - Environment diagnostic
- `RUN_PROGRESSIVE_TEST.sh` - Bash runner
- `RUNPOD_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Testing guide
- `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Existing Files (unchanged):
- `test_zstd_inference.py` - Still there for single-layer testing
- `test_zstd_inference_10layers.py` - Still there (tests 5 layers)
- `bindings_zstd.py` - No changes to core codec
- All encoder/decoder C++ files - No changes

---

## üîß Technical Details

### Test Configuration:
- **Model**: TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 (155 linear layers)
- **Quantization**: Per-channel (row-wise) INT8
- **Compression**: Zstd level 9 via nvCOMP
- **Generation**: 10 tokens, greedy (do_sample=False)
- **Prompt**: "The capital of France is"

### What Each Test Does:
1. **Baseline**: Uncompressed inference for reference
2. **1 layer**: Minimal compression (validate codec works)
3. **5 layers**: Light compression (check multi-layer interaction)
4. **10 layers**: Medium compression (balance speed/quality)
5. **20 layers**: Heavy compression (stress test quantization)

### Layer Selection Strategy:
Compresses the **first N layers** in model traversal order (likely embeddings and early transformer blocks). This is intentional:
- Early layers are less sensitive to quantization
- If these fail, no point testing more layers
- If these pass, we can scale to attention/MLP layers

## üí° Key Insights

### Why This Matters:
The playbook shows artifacts with 1 layer, but documentation claims per-channel quantization was fixed. **We need to verify which is the current truth.**

### What We're Testing:
1. **Single layer compression**: Does basic codec work?
2. **Multi-layer compression**: Does quality degrade with more layers?
3. **Quantization accuracy**: Is per-channel quantization actually working?
4. **Performance trend**: How does slowdown scale with layer count?

### Expected Outcomes:
- **Best case**: All tests ‚úì PERFECT ‚Üí Scale to full model
- **Good case**: Minor diffs acceptable ‚Üí Tune quantization parameters
- **Bad case**: Major artifacts ‚Üí Debug quantization (scales, broadcasting, compression)

---

## üìû Next Communication

After you run the tests, share the **FINAL SUMMARY** section output. I'll help interpret results and plan next steps:

- **If good**: We scale to 50+ layers and optimize performance
- **If bad**: We debug quantization with targeted fixes
- **If environment issues**: We fix setup and retry

## ‚úÖ Checklist

Before running tests:
- [ ] RunPod instance is running with RTX 5090
- [ ] Latest code pulled (`git pull`)
- [ ] Environment check passes (`check_runpod_status.py`)

After running tests:
- [ ] Note which layers show ‚úì PERFECT vs ‚ö† MINOR vs ‚úó MAJOR
- [ ] Copy FINAL SUMMARY table
- [ ] Check VRAM usage trend (should be stable)
- [ ] Note any errors or unexpected behavior

**Ready to test! üöÄ** The hard work of setting up the test framework is done. Now we just need to run it and see where the quantization quality actually stands.
